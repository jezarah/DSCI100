# DSCI100

A Data Science project from the beginning (downloading data from the web) to the end (communicating their methods and conclusions in an electronic report). The electronic report will be a Jupyter notebook in which the code cells will download a dataset from the web, reproducibly and sensibly wrangle and clean, summarize and visualize the data, as well as appropriately answer a predictive question. Markdown cells will be used throughout the document to narrate the analysis to communicates the question asked, methods used and the conclusion reached.


For this project, we formulate and answer a predictive question about a dataset using either classification or regression.
